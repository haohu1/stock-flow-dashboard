# Disease Incidence Rate Analysis for 1 Million Population

## Current Disease Profiles and Annual Cases per Million:

### 1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
- Current lambda: 0.012 (1.2% annual incidence)
- Target population: Adults >65 years (~5% of population in SSA = 50,000)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 12,000 total OR 600 among elderly (if age-specific)
- WHO/Literature: ~1-2% prevalence in elderly, 0.5-1% annual incidence
- **Recommendation**: Adjust to 0.002 (2,000 cases/million) for general population

### 2. Tuberculosis
- Current lambda: 0.003 (0.3% annual incidence)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 3,000 cases
- WHO SSA average: 200-300 per 100,000 (2,000-3,000 per million)
- **Current rate is appropriate**

### 3. Childhood Pneumonia
- Current lambda: 0.25 (25% annual incidence)
- Target population: Under-5 children (~20% of population = 200,000)
- Annual cases: 250,000 total OR 50,000 among under-5s
- WHO data: 0.22-0.29 episodes per child-year in SSA
- **Current rate is appropriate for under-5 population**

### 4. Malaria
- Current lambda: 0.20 (20% annual incidence)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 200,000 cases
- WHO Nigeria: ~25% incidence in high-burden states, 6% national average
- **Recommendation**: Keep at 0.20 for high-burden areas, or adjust to 0.06 for national average**

### 5. Fever (Non-specific)
- Current lambda: 0.60 (60% annual incidence)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 600,000 cases
- Literature: Multiple febrile episodes common in tropical settings
- **Current rate is reasonable for all febrile episodes**

### 6. Diarrhea
- Current lambda: 1.50 (150% annual incidence)
- Target population: Primarily under-5 children
- Annual cases: 1,500,000 total OR 300,000 among under-5s (1.5 episodes/child/year)
- WHO data: 2-3 episodes per child-year in SSA
- **Recommendation**: Adjust to 0.30 for general population (300,000 cases/million)**

### 7. Anemia
- Current lambda: 0.20 (20% annual incidence of symptomatic cases)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 200,000 cases
- WHO: 40-60% prevalence in women/children, but most asymptomatic
- **Recommendation**: Adjust to 0.05 (50,000 symptomatic cases/million)**

### 8. HIV Management (Chronic)
- Current lambda: 0.005 (0.5% annual new diagnoses)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 5,000 new diagnoses
- South Africa HIV incidence: ~1% annually
- **Recommendation**: Adjust to 0.01 for South Africa context (10,000 new cases/million)**

### 9. High-Risk Pregnancy
- Current lambda: 0.02 (2% annual incidence)
- Target population: Women of reproductive age (~25% = 250,000)
- Annual cases: 20,000 total OR 5,000 among WRA
- WHO: 15-20% of pregnancies have complications
- **Current rate is appropriate**

### 10. URTI
- Current lambda: 2.0 (200% annual incidence)
- Annual cases in 1M population: 2,000,000 cases
- Literature: 2-5 episodes per person-year common
- **Current rate is appropriate**

### 11. HIV Opportunistic Infections
- Current lambda: 0.04 (4% annual incidence among PLHIV)
- PLHIV in South Africa: ~13.5% of population = 135,000
- Annual OI cases: 40,000 total OR 5,400 among PLHIV
- **Recommendation**: Express as general population rate: 0.005 (5,000 cases/million)**

## Summary of Recommended Adjustments:

1. **CHF**: 0.012 → 0.002 (age-adjusted for general population)
2. **TB**: Keep 0.003 ✓
3. **Childhood Pneumonia**: Keep 0.25 (for under-5 population) ✓
4. **Malaria**: Keep 0.20 for endemic areas ✓
5. **Fever**: Keep 0.60 ✓
6. **Diarrhea**: 1.50 → 0.30 (population-adjusted)
7. **Anemia**: 0.20 → 0.05 (symptomatic cases only)
8. **HIV Chronic**: 0.005 → 0.01 (South Africa context)
9. **High-Risk Pregnancy**: Keep 0.02 ✓
10. **URTI**: Keep 2.0 ✓
11. **HIV OIs**: 0.04 → 0.005 (population-adjusted)

## Key Considerations:
- Some diseases (pneumonia, diarrhea) primarily affect children
- Age-specific rates need population adjustment
- Endemic disease rates vary by region
- Symptomatic vs asymptomatic cases matter for health system burden
