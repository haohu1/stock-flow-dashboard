# Disease-Specific AI Effects Critical Review

## Summary of Issues

### 1. Duplicate Entries
- **Congestive Heart Failure**: Has two entries (lines 1532 and 1677). First one should be removed.

### 2. Self-Care AI Effectiveness Issues

| Disease | Current | Recommended | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Tuberculosis | 20% | 5% | Adherence support only, not treatment |
| High-risk pregnancy | 15% | 3% | Danger sign recognition only |
| Childhood pneumonia | 2% | 10% | Parent education on danger signs is valuable |
| HIV management | 30% | 20% | Adherence apps proven but not transformative |
| Malaria | 5% | 15% | Prevention education, early symptom recognition |

### 3. Missing AI Interventions

**Childhood Pneumonia** - Add:
- Triage AI: phi0Effect: 0.15, sigmaIEffect: 1.25 (respiratory distress recognition)
- Hospital Decision AI: delta2Effect: 0.85, delta3Effect: 0.80 (ventilation protocols)
- Bed Management AI: Standard values with focus on pediatric units

**Malaria** - Add:
- Triage AI: phi0Effect: 0.12, sigmaIEffect: 1.20 (fever pattern recognition)
- Hospital Decision AI: delta2Effect: 0.85, delta3Effect: 0.80 (severe malaria protocols)

**Diarrhea** - Add:
- Hospital Decision AI: delta2Effect: 0.88, delta3Effect: 0.85 (severe dehydration management)

**Tuberculosis** - Add:
- Triage AI: phi0Effect: 0.18, sigmaIEffect: 1.15 (symptom screening algorithms)

### 4. Logic Issues

**High-risk pregnancy Diagnostic AI**:
- Current: mu1Effect: 0.15 (increases resolution) AND rho1Effect: 1.25 (increases referrals)
- Issue: Contradictory - if AI identifies complications, it should increase referrals but NOT resolution
- Recommendation: mu1Effect: 0.05, keep rho1Effect: 1.25

**HIV opportunistic infections**:
- CHW referral increase of 35% might overwhelm hospitals
- Consider reducing to 1.20 (20% increase)

### 5. Clinical Appropriateness

**Generally Well-Designed:**
- Malaria: Good balance across interventions
- Diarrhea: Excellent emphasis on self-care (ORS)
- URTI: Appropriately minimal effects
- Anemia: Good CHW and diagnostic focus

**Need Adjustment:**
- TB: Overemphasis on self-care, needs more triage
- High-risk pregnancy: Too optimistic about informal care resolution
- HIV management: May overestimate adherence app impact

## Recommendations

1. Remove duplicate CHF entry
2. Adjust self-care AI effectiveness to be more clinically appropriate
3. Add missing AI interventions for comprehensive coverage
4. Fix logical contradictions in referral/resolution patterns
5. Consider adding brief explanatory comments for each disease's AI strategy

## Implementation Priority

1. **High**: Fix duplicate CHF, adjust TB and pregnancy self-care values
2. **Medium**: Add missing triage AI interventions
3. **Low**: Fine-tune other effectiveness values based on evidence
