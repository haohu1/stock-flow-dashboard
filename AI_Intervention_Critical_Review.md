# Critical Review of AI Intervention Effects in Stock-Flow Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This review analyzes the AI intervention effects implemented in the stock-flow healthcare dashboard model. The analysis reveals a mix of conservative, realistic, and potentially overestimated effects across different AI interventions and diseases. Key findings include:

1. **Mortality reduction effects are generally conservative** (8-10% baseline), which is appropriate
2. **Resolution rate improvements vary appropriately** by intervention type and disease
3. **Referral/routing improvements could be transformative** but need careful validation
4. **Queue/efficiency improvements show realistic potential** for system optimization

## Default AI Intervention Effects Analysis

### 1. AI Health Advisor (Triage AI)

**Current Effects:**
- φ₀ (formal care seeking): +8% increase

- Resource utilization: 20% better bed use

**Assessment:**
- **Appropriate**: 10% mortality reduction is conservative but realistic
- **Evidence-based**: Aligns with clinical decision support showing 5-15% mortality reductions
- **Balanced**: Efficiency gains are achievable without being overly optimistic

**Recommendation**: Current effects are well-calibrated.

### 6. AI Self-Care Platform

## Critical Assessment Summary

### Likely Overestimated Effects:
1. **Childhood pneumonia diagnostic AI at 30%** - Consider reducing to 20-25%
2. **Some disease-specific referral reductions of 25%** - May be optimistic for complex cases
3. **Queue prevention rates of 20-30%** - Depends heavily on implementation quality

### Likely Underestimated Effects:
1. **CHW baseline resolution at 5%** - Could be 10% with good AI
2. **Diagnostic AI baseline at 6%** - Could be 10-12% for many conditions
3. **Self-care visit reduction at 20%** - Could reach 30-40% with mature platforms

### Transformative but Realistic:
1. **Smart routing (30%)** - Game-changing for system efficiency
2. **TB diagnostic AI (35%)** - Matches real-world evidence
3. **Length of stay reduction (20%)** - Achievable with operations AI
4. **Malaria CHW AI (25%)** - Point-of-care testing transformation

### Appropriately Conservative:
1. **Mortality reductions (8-10%)** - Avoids overpromising on life-saving
2. **CHF effects** - Correctly models medical complexity
3. **Hospital decision support** - Balanced efficiency and safety gains

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain conservative mortality estimates** - Current 8-10% baseline is appropriate
2. **Consider increasing baseline resolution effects** - CHW from 5% to 8-10%, Diagnostic from 6% to 10%
3. **Validate routing/efficiency gains** - These could be truly transformative if achieved
4. **Add implementation quality modifiers** - Effects should scale with infrastructure/training quality
5. **Consider time-to-impact delays** - Full effects may take 6-12 months post-deployment
6. **Monitor disease-specific evidence** - Update effects as more pilot data emerges

## Conclusion

The AI intervention effects in this model are generally well-calibrated, with appropriate conservatism around mortality while allowing for transformative efficiency gains. The disease-specific customizations show sophisticated understanding of where AI can have differential impact. The main areas for refinement are slightly increasing baseline resolution effects for CHW and diagnostic AI, while maintaining the conservative approach to mortality reduction.
