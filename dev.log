## EquationExplainer Multi-Disease Review - 2025-06-04

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed orphaned variables** - Cleaned up leftover variables without associated equation blocks (lines 154-163)

2. **Reorganized component structure** for better readability:
   - Added clear multi-disease overview section at the top
   - Separated core system equations (with expandable details) from detailed system equations
   - Better visual hierarchy with proper section headers

3. **Improved multi-disease flow**:
   - Clear explanation of how diseases are calculated independently
   - Individual disease parameter buttons show incidence rates and burden categories
   - Disease-specific equations are shown when clicking on a disease
   - Clear aggregation section showing how results are summed

4. **Type safety improvements**:
   - Added proper TypeScript types for equations and variables
   - Removed 'any' types where possible
   - Better type definitions for function parameters

5. **Visual improvements**:
   - Better use of color coding (purple for multi-disease, orange for individual diseases)
   - Clear separation between different equation sections
   - Expandable core equations for less clutter

### Result:
The equation tab is now much more readable and informative for multi-disease scenarios. Users can:
- Understand the overall calculation approach
- View core system equations that apply to all diseases
- Click individual diseases to see their specific parameters and equations
- Understand how results are aggregated across diseases
