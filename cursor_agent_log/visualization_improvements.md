# Visualization Improvements Log

## Dynamic Stock and Flow Diagram Implementation

**Date:** 2023-06-06
**Action:** Added new component
**Files Affected:** 
- components/StockFlowDiagram.tsx (created)
- components/EquationExplainer.tsx (modified)

**Summary:**  
Created a dynamic stock and flow diagram using D3.js to replace the static PNG image in the "Model Equations" tab. The new diagram:
- Renders dynamically based on actual model parameters
- Shows flows with their actual values and proportions
- Highlights active AI interventions with green color
- Includes a legend showing which AI interventions are active

**Technical Details:**
- Used D3.js to render SVG graphics
- Connected to the existing model state using Jotai atoms
- Drew stocks as rectangles and flows as paths with arrows
- Applied different colors to each type of node for better visualization
- Added hover effects for better interactivity
- Implemented dynamic highlighting of AI intervention pathways

**Future Improvements:**
- Add animations to show the flow of patients through the system
- Implement interactive tooltips showing more detailed information
- Add the ability to click on nodes to see detailed statistics
- Make the diagram responsive for different screen sizes

## Layout Refinement for Stock and Flow Diagram

**Date:** 2023-06-07
**Action:** Updated component
**Files Affected:** 
- components/StockFlowDiagram.tsx (modified)

**Summary:**  
Refined the layout of the dynamic stock and flow diagram to match the reference PNG image more closely:
- Repositioned nodes to match the original layout
- Used quadratic Bezier curves for flow paths instead of orthogonal lines
- Improved label positioning for better readability
- Adjusted diagram dimensions to accommodate the layout
- Implemented better number formatting for transition rates

**Technical Details:**
- Added control points for curved paths using quadratic bezier curves
- Used a more sophisticated number formatting function to display appropriate decimal places
- Increased overall diagram size to provide better spacing
- Refined the legend positioning and styling
- Added a light background color to the SVG
- Made SVG responsive with proper width constraints

**Visual Improvements:**
- Curved flow paths that better represent the conceptual flow of patients
- More accurately positioned transition rate labels
- Better visual separation between nodes
- Improved clarity for AI intervention highlighting
