HealthSystem,Moderate Urban System,A middle-tier healthcare system in urban settings with reasonable infrastructure. Represents typical urban healthcare in middle-income countries.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.65,0.25,0.15,"Features 65% initial formal care seeking and 25% transition from informal to formal care. Has standard mortality rates across all levels of care, with balanced referral patterns. Per diem costs range from $7 (informal) to $350 (tertiary).",AI interventions have standard effectiveness in this balanced system.
HealthSystem,Weak Rural System,Limited healthcare capacity in rural areas with poor access. Significant challenges in healthcare delivery and outcomes.,0.6,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.7,1.5,1.8,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.3,0.1,0.4,"Only 30% of patients initially seek formal care, and just 10% transition from informal to formal care later. Features 40% higher untreated rates, significantly reduced resolution rates (40-50% below standard), and 50-100% higher mortality rates.",AI interventions can be transformative but face implementation challenges due to infrastructure limitations.
HealthSystem,Strong Urban System LMIC,An aspirational high-quality system in lower/middle-income urban areas. Represents best-in-class urban healthcare in developing countries.,1.2,1.3,1.3,1.2,1.1,0.8,0.7,1.1,1.1,1.1,0.8,0.35,0.1,High initial formal care seeking (80%) and good transition from informal care (35%). Features 20-30% better resolution rates and 20-40% lower mortality compared to baseline. Has efficient referral pathways and higher quality infrastructure.,AI interventions can be highly effective and well-integrated into existing digital systems.
HealthSystem,Fragile Conflict System,Severely compromised healthcare in humanitarian crisis or conflict zones. Extremely challenging healthcare delivery environment.,0.4,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,2.5,2.3,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.08,0.6,Extremely limited access (only 20% seek formal care) with 60% remaining completely untreated. Resolution effectiveness is reduced by 40-70% with mortality 50-150% higher than normal. Referral pathways are broken (60-80% reduced).,AI interventions face significant implementation barriers but can provide critical decision support where healthcare workers are overwhelmed.
HealthSystem,High Income System,World-class healthcare in wealthy nations with nearly universal access. Represents healthcare systems in developed countries.,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.6,1.5,0.5,0.4,1.2,1.2,1.2,0.9,0.7,0.05,Features 90% formal care seeking and 70% transition from informal to formal care. Has 50-70% better resolution rates and 50-70% lower mortality compared to standard. Very efficient referral patterns but substantially higher costs ($15-1200 per day).,AI interventions can be seamlessly integrated but may show less dramatic improvements due to already high baseline performance.
