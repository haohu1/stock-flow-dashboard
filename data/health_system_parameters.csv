HealthSystem,Moderate Urban System,A middle-tier healthcare system in urban settings with reasonable infrastructure. Represents typical urban healthcare in middle-income countries.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.65,0.25,0.15,"Features 65% initial formal care seeking and 25% transition from informal to formal care. Has standard mortality rates across all levels of care, with balanced referral patterns. Per diem costs range from $7 (informal) to $350 (tertiary).",AI interventions have standard effectiveness in this balanced system.
HealthSystem,Weak Rural System,Limited healthcare capacity in rural areas with poor access. Significant challenges in healthcare delivery and outcomes.,0.6,0.5,0.5,0.6,0.7,1.5,1.8,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.30,0.10,0.40,"Only 30% of patients initially seek formal care, and just 10% transition from informal to formal care later. Features 40% higher untreated rates, significantly reduced resolution rates (40-50% below standard), and 50-100% higher mortality rates.",AI interventions can be transformative but face implementation challenges due to infrastructure limitations.
HealthSystem,Strong Urban System LMIC,An aspirational high-quality system in lower/middle-income urban areas. Represents best-in-class urban healthcare in developing countries.,1.2,1.3,1.3,1.2,1.1,0.8,0.7,1.1,1.1,1.1,0.80,0.35,0.10,"High initial formal care seeking (80%) and good transition from informal care (35%). Features 20-30% better resolution rates and 20-40% lower mortality compared to baseline. Has efficient referral pathways and higher quality infrastructure.",AI interventions can be highly effective and well-integrated into existing digital systems.
HealthSystem,Fragile Conflict System,Severely compromised healthcare in humanitarian crisis or conflict zones. Extremely challenging healthcare delivery environment.,0.4,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,2.5,2.3,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.20,0.08,0.60,"Extremely limited access (only 20% seek formal care) with 60% remaining completely untreated. Resolution effectiveness is reduced by 40-70% with mortality 50-150% higher than normal. Referral pathways are broken (60-80% reduced).",AI interventions face significant implementation barriers but can provide critical decision support where healthcare workers are overwhelmed.
HealthSystem,High Income System,World-class healthcare in wealthy nations with nearly universal access. Represents healthcare systems in developed countries.,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.6,1.5,0.5,0.4,1.2,1.2,1.2,0.90,0.70,0.05,"Features 90% formal care seeking and 70% transition from informal to formal care. Has 50-70% better resolution rates and 50-70% lower mortality compared to standard. Very efficient referral patterns but substantially higher costs ($15-1200 per day).",AI interventions can be seamlessly integrated but may show less dramatic improvements due to already high baseline performance.
VerticalTeam,Maternal and Child Health,Focuses on improving outcomes for pregnant women and children under 5.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Encompasses high-risk pregnancies, infant pneumonia, childhood diarrhea, and nutritional conditions like anemia. Often requires strong referral systems to manage complications.","Triage AI and CHW Decision Support are particularly valuable for identifying complications early. Diagnostic AI has demonstrated 15-20% improvement in pediatric diagnosis accuracy."
VerticalTeam,Infectious Disease Control,Addresses high-burden infectious diseases in low-resource settings.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Includes tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, and fever management. Focuses on early detection, appropriate treatment, and adherence to long-term protocols.","CHW Decision Support has shown 25% improvement in protocol adherence. Diagnostic AI can reduce time to diagnosis by 30-50% for complex infectious cases."
VerticalTeam,Chronic Disease Management,Manages long-term conditions requiring continuous care and monitoring.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Includes HIV management, congestive heart failure, and other non-communicable diseases. Emphasizes adherence, complication monitoring, and managing across care levels.","Self-Care Apps demonstrate 30% improvement in medication adherence. Hospital Decision Support AI shows 20% reduction in readmission rates for chronic conditions."
VerticalTeam,Primary Health Care,Strengthens front-line healthcare delivery for common conditions.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Covers high-volume conditions like URTI, diarrhea, and uncomplicated fever. Focuses on appropriate management at lower levels of care to prevent overburdening hospitals.","Triage AI reduces unnecessary visits by up to 25%. Diagnostic AI improves appropriate referral decisions by 15-30% at primary care level."
VerticalTeam,Emergency Medical Services,Improves outcomes for acute and emergency conditions.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Addresses severe complications across diseases including severe malaria, acute cardiac events, and obstetric emergencies. Emphasizes rapid triage, stabilization, and appropriate level of care.","Triage AI can reduce critical delays by 40-60%. Hospital Decision Support and Bed Management AI together improve emergency department flow by 25-35%."
