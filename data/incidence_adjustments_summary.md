# Summary of Disease Incidence Rate Adjustments

## Changes Made to Ensure Realistic Rates for 1 Million Population

### Adjusted Disease Incidence Rates:

1. **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**
   - Old: 0.012 (12,000 cases/million)
   - New: 0.002 (2,000 cases/million)
   - Rationale: Age-adjusted for general population; realistic for all ages

2. **Diarrhea**
   - Old: 1.50 (1,500,000 cases/million)
   - New: 0.30 (300,000 cases/million)
   - Rationale: Population-adjusted; accounts for higher rates in children

3. **Anemia**
   - Old: 0.20 (200,000 cases/million)
   - New: 0.05 (50,000 cases/million)
   - Rationale: Only symptomatic cases requiring treatment

4. **HIV Management (Chronic)**
   - Old: 0.005 (5,000 new cases/million)
   - New: 0.01 (10,000 new cases/million)
   - Rationale: Adjusted for South African context with higher HIV incidence

5. **HIV Opportunistic Infections**
   - Old: 0.04 (40,000 cases/million - but was per PLHIV)
   - New: 0.005 (5,000 cases/million)
   - Rationale: Population-adjusted rate for general population

### Rates Kept Unchanged:

- **Tuberculosis**: 0.003 (3,000 cases/million) - Matches WHO data
- **Childhood Pneumonia**: 0.25 (50,000 cases in under-5s) - Appropriate for age group
- **Malaria**: 0.20 (200,000 cases/million) - Appropriate for endemic areas
- **Fever**: 0.60 (600,000 cases/million) - Reasonable for all febrile episodes
- **High-Risk Pregnancy**: 0.02 (20,000 cases/million) - Appropriate rate
- **URTI**: 2.0 (2,000,000 cases/million) - Common condition with multiple episodes

## Key Improvements:

1. **Population-based rates**: All rates now reflect incidence per general population of 1 million
2. **Age-adjustment**: Rates for age-specific diseases (CHF, childhood diseases) adjusted for general population
3. **Symptomatic focus**: Anemia rate now reflects only symptomatic cases needing care
4. **Regional context**: HIV rates adjusted for South African context
5. **Realistic burden**: Total disease burden now more realistic for health system capacity

## Total Annual Cases per Million (After Adjustments):
- URTI: 2,000,000
- Fever: 600,000
- Diarrhea: 300,000
- Malaria: 200,000
- Anemia: 50,000
- Childhood Pneumonia: 50,000 (in under-5s)
- High-Risk Pregnancy: 20,000
- HIV New Cases: 10,000
- HIV OIs: 5,000
- Tuberculosis: 3,000
- CHF: 2,000

Total episodes: ~3,190,000 per year (many people have multiple episodes)
