## Log Entry - Step 3: lib/store.ts Modifications

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `lib/store.ts`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Renamed `selectedGeographyAtom` to `selectedHealthSystemStrengthAtom` (defaulting to `moderate_urban_system`).
    *   Introduced `HealthSystemMultipliers` interface and `healthSystemMultipliersAtom` to store and derive multipliers from the selected health system scenario.
    *   Modified `getDerivedParamsForDisease`:
        *   Takes `healthSystemStrength` string and `activeMultipliers` object as arguments.
        *   Applies direct parameters (e.g., `phi0`, `perDiemCosts`) from the chosen `healthSystemStrengthDefaults` scenario.
        *   Applies `activeMultipliers` to the base `mu`, `delta`, and `rho` parameters fetched from `diseaseProfiles`.
        *   Includes clamping for probabilities (0-1).
    *   Updated `derivedParametersAtom` and `runSimulationAtom` to use `selectedHealthSystemStrengthAtom` and pass `activeMultipliers` to `getDerivedParamsForDisease`.
    *   Updated `Scenario` interface: `geography?: string` changed to `healthSystemStrength?: string`.
*   **Reasoning:** To support configurable health system strength scenarios that modulate disease parameters via multipliers, and to prepare for UI-editable multipliers.
*   **Note:** Linter errors were reported post-edit (`Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'number & { I: number; ... }'`). Further investigation may be needed if these persist and cause runtime issues. The core logic seems to align with requirements.

## Log Entry - Sub-Step 5.1: lib/store.ts healthSystemMultipliersAtom Writable

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `lib/store.ts`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Changed `healthSystemMultipliersAtom` from a derived read-only atom to a simple writable atom.
    *   Initialized `healthSystemMultipliersAtom` with the default multiplier values from the `moderate_urban_system` scenario. This atom is intended to be updated by `ParametersPanel.tsx` when a scenario is selected or when the user edits multipliers.
*   **Reasoning:** To allow UI components to directly set the values of health system strength multipliers.
*   **Note:** The persistent linter error `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'number & { I: number; ... }'` in `getDerivedParamsForDisease` remains.

## Log Entry - Step 6 & 7: Dashboard Update and Final Review

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified & Reviewed
*   **File Path:** `components/Dashboard.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes (Dashboard.tsx):**
    *   Added a local function `formatHealthSystemName`.
    *   Updated display to use `currentScenario.parameters.healthSystemStrength` with formatting, changing label from "Geography" to "Health System".
*   **Reasoning:** To reflect the new health system strength parameter in the dashboard display.

*   **Overall Review:**
    *   Completed refactoring from concrete geographies to abstract health system strength scenarios.
    *   Implemented direct health system parameters and outcome multipliers (for mu, delta, rho) per scenario.
    *   Updated `lib/store.ts` for new parameter derivation logic (with persistent linter error).
    *   Updated `components/ParametersPanel.tsx` with scenario selection and a new UI for editing multipliers.
    *   Updated `components/Dashboard.tsx` for display.
    *   The main functionality regarding health system scenarios and editable multipliers is implemented.
*   **Remaining Issue:** Persistent linter error in `lib/store.ts` (`Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'number & { I: number; ... }'`) within `getDerivedParamsForDisease`.

## Log Entry - Linter Error Fix in lib/store.ts

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `lib/store.ts`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Resolved a persistent TypeScript linter error (`Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'number & { ... }'`) within the `getDerivedParamsForDisease` function.
    *   The fix involved changing the `probabilityParams` array (renamed to `probabilityParamKeys`) to use an `as const` assertion. This provides stricter literal types for the iterated keys.
    *   As a result, TypeScript can correctly infer that `params[pKey]` refers to a `number` property during assignment, eliminating the type mismatch.
*   **Reasoning:** To fix linter errors and improve the type safety of parameter manipulation within the store.

## Log Entry - Runtime Error Fix in Sidebar.tsx

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/Sidebar.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Addressed a runtime error "Error: Atom is undefined or null" that originated from `Sidebar.tsx` trying to use `selectedGeographyAtom`.
    *   Changed the import from `selectedGeographyAtom` to the correctly refactored `selectedHealthSystemStrengthAtom` from `lib/store.ts`.
    *   Updated the `useAtom` call, state variables (`selectedHealthSystemStrength`, `setSelectedHealthSystemStrength`), and the event handler (`handleHealthSystemChange`).
    *   Modified the JSX to change the label from "Geography" to "Health System Scenario".
    *   Dynamically populated the health system scenario dropdown options by importing `healthSystemStrengthDefaults` from `models/stockAndFlowModel.ts` and mapping over its keys. This ensures the UI accurately lists the available scenarios defined in the model.
*   **Reasoning:** The previous refactoring of `selectedGeographyAtom` to `selectedHealthSystemStrengthAtom` in `lib/store.ts` was not propagated to `components/Sidebar.tsx`, leading to the component trying to use an undefined atom.

## Log Entry - UI Enhancements in ParametersPanel.tsx

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/ParametersPanel.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   **Reordered Parameter Groups:**
        *   The `parameterGroups` array was restructured to display "Disease Characteristics" first.
        *   Health system-specific economic parameters (per diem costs, life expectancy, discount rate) were grouped with other health system-specific categories.
        *   A new group "AI Related Parameters" was created for AI-specific economic and effectiveness parameters, marked with `isAISpecific: true`.
        *   The rendering logic for parameter groups was consolidated into a single loop over `parameterGroups`, applying conditional tags (e.g., "(Disease-Specific)", "(Health System Specific)", "(AI Related)") and styling within the loop based on group flags and custom mode status.
    *   **Highlighted Health System Outcome Multipliers:**
        *   Added a "(Health System Specific)" tag next to the "Health System Outcome Multipliers" title when a specific health system scenario is selected (i.e., `!customHealthSystem`).
        *   Applied conditional styling (green border and background) to the multiplier input containers and the input fields themselves when `!customHealthSystem` is true, visually indicating their link to the selected health system scenario.
    *   **Enhanced the UI to better indicate which parameter groups contain values derived from the selected disease profile.**
    *   Previously, only the primary "Disease Characteristics" group was tagged as "(Disease-Specific)".
    *   Now, other groups (e.g., "Informal Care", "Primary Care (L1)") will display a "(Contains Disease-Specific Params)" tag if any parameter within them (like `muI`, `delta0`, `rho1`, etc.) is sourced from the `diseaseProfiles` for the currently selected disease (and custom disease mode is not active).
    *   The individual parameter input fields within these groups continue to be highlighted blue if their values are directly from the disease profile.
*   **Reasoning:** To improve the usability and clarity of the `ParametersPanel` by organizing parameters more logically (disease-specific first) and providing clear visual cues for health system-specific multipliers and other parameter categories.

## Log Entry - Corrected UI Layout in ParametersPanel.tsx

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/ParametersPanel.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Corrected the position of the "Health System Outcome Multipliers" section.
    *   This section was intended to be after the main parameter groups loop but was previously still appearing before it (directly after the "Settings" section).
    *   The JSX block for "Health System Outcome Multipliers" has now been explicitly moved to render *after* the `parameterGroups.map(...)` loop completes, making it the last major editable section in the panel.
*   **Reasoning:** To ensure the UI layout matches the intended logical flow of parameter presentation, with general settings first, then detailed parameter groups, and finally the health system outcome multipliers.

## Log Entry - Updated Multiplier UI with Greek Letters in ParametersPanel.tsx

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/ParametersPanel.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Updated the UI for the "Health System Outcome Multipliers" section to use Greek letters for enhanced clarity and mathematical convention.
    *   Resolution rate (μ) multipliers are now denoted by `α` (alpha).
    *   Mortality rate (δ) multipliers are now denoted by `β` (beta).
    *   Referral rate (ρ) multipliers are now denoted by `γ` (gamma).
    *   Group titles were updated, e.g., "Resolution Multipliers (μ)" changed to "Resolution Rate Multipliers (α) (Base: μ)".
    *   Individual multiplier labels were updated to use the Greek symbol with a Unicode subscript indicating the level (e.g., αL₀, βᵢ, γL₂) and a descriptive name like "αL₀ (L0-Level Resolution)".
    *   Associated `htmlFor` and `id` attributes were added to labels and inputs for accessibility.
*   **Reasoning:** To improve the clarity and mathematical representation of health system outcome multipliers in the user interface.
*   **Note:** The corresponding update to an equations display component was deferred as the component (`components/EquationsDisplay.tsx`) was found not to exist. This can be addressed if the component is created later.

## Log Entry - Updated EquationExplainer.tsx with Multiplier Symbols

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/EquationExplainer.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Updated the component to display health system outcome multipliers (`α`, `β`, `γ`) within the equation strings and variable lists.
    *   Imported `healthSystemMultipliersAtom` and `HealthSystemMultipliers` from `lib/store.ts` and accessed `activeMultipliers`.
    *   Added a helper function `getMultiplierSymbol` to generate string representations of Greek letter multipliers with appropriate Unicode subscripts (e.g., αᵢ, β₍L0₎).
    *   Modified the `equations` array for relevant sections (Untreated, Informal, L0-L3 transitions, Cumulative Outcomes):
        *   Equation strings now include the multiplier symbol string (e.g., `U_deaths = βᵤ × δU × U`).
        *   The `variables` list for each section now includes entries for each applicable multiplier, displaying its symbol, name (e.g., "Untreated Death Multiplier (βᵤ)"), and current value.
        *   Base rates (μ, δ, ρ) in the variable list are now explicitly named "Base ... Rate".
        *   Explanations and example calculations were updated to reflect the presence and impact of these multipliers.
*   **Reasoning:** To ensure the "Model Equations" display accurately reflects how health system outcome multipliers modify the base disease parameters, enhancing transparency for the user.
*   **Note:** This update uses string and Unicode character representation for the multipliers in the equations, not full LaTeX rendering. Full LaTeX rendering can be considered as a future enhancement if more precise mathematical typesetting is required.

## Log Entry - LaTeX Rendering in EquationExplainer.tsx

*   **Timestamp:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
*   **Action Type:** Modified
*   **File Path:** `components/EquationExplainer.tsx`, `pages/_app.tsx`
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   **Dependency Installation:** Installed `react-katex` and `katex` (and `@types/react-katex` for TypeScript) to enable LaTeX rendering.
    *   **CSS Import:** Added `import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css';` to `pages/_app.tsx` for KaTeX styling.
    *   **`EquationExplainer.tsx` Refactor:**
        *   Imported `BlockMath` and `InlineMath` from `react-katex`.
        *   Updated the `getLatexMultiplierSymbol` helper to generate LaTeX-formatted multiplier symbols (e.g., `\\alpha_{L0}`).
        *   Converted all `equation` strings in the `equations` array to valid LaTeX syntax (e.g., using `\\frac`, `\\cdot`, `\\lambda`, `\\phi_0`, `_{L0}`).
        *   Replaced direct string rendering of equations with `<BlockMath math={eq.equation} />`.
        *   Updated the rendering of symbols in the `variables` list to use `<InlineMath math={variable.symbol} />` for consistent LaTeX display.
        *   Adjusted `example` strings that previously used template literals with backslashes to use string concatenation to avoid conflicts with LaTeX interpretation, and fixed a syntax error in one such string.
    *   **Linter Errors Resolved:** Addressed a type definition error for `react-katex` by installing `@types/react-katex` and fixed a syntax error in an example string.
*   **Reasoning:** To significantly improve the visual presentation and readability of mathematical equations in the "Model Equations" section by using LaTeX rendering via `react-katex`.

## Log Entry: 2023-10-27 10:00:00
**Action Type:** Investigation
**Files Affected:** `models/stockAndFlowModel.ts`
**Summary of Changes:** Investigated the `totalCost` calculation in `calculateEconomics` function. Found that `totalCost` is a sum of `patientDaysCost` (per-diem costs multiplied by patient days at various care levels) and `aiCost` (fixed and variable AI costs). The cost parameters (`perDiemCosts`, `aiFixedCost`, `aiVariableCost`) are part of `ModelParameters`.
**Reasoning:** User asked if the `totalCost` calculation was disease-specific. The calculation structure itself is generic, but its application can be disease-specific if different cost parameters are used for different disease simulations.

## Log Entry: 2023-10-27 10:15:00
**Action Type:** Investigation
**Files Affected:** `models/stockAndFlowModel.ts`, `lib/store.ts`
**Summary of Changes:** Further investigated how treatment costs are differentiated for different diseases. Confirmed that `perDiemCosts` are sourced from `healthSystemStrengthDefaults` and are not part of `diseaseProfiles`. The primary cost differentiation between diseases (e.g., LRTI vs. heart failure) in the current model comes from differences in `patientDays` at various care levels, which are driven by disease-specific epidemiological parameters (`lambda`, `mu`, `delta`, `rho`) defined in `diseaseProfiles`.
**Reasoning:** User asked for clarification on whether costs for different diseases are differentiated only by `patientDays`. Confirmed this is largely the case for the rate component (`perDiemCosts`), as these rates are currently health-system-specific, not disease-specific.
**Potential Modifications Discussed:** 
1. Adding `perDiemCosts` to `diseaseProfiles` (Large impact).
2. Introducing disease-specific cost multipliers/adjustments (Medium impact).
3. Post-hoc cost adjustments (Small to Medium impact).
