# Final Review: Disease-Specific AI Effects

## Key Changes Based on Treatment Capability

### Principle Applied
Self-care AI effectiveness depends on whether it can guide **actual treatment** vs just **advice/monitoring**:
- High effects (15-25%): Complete home treatment possible (diarrhea ORS, URTI symptomatic care)
- Medium effects (8-15%): Partial treatment or supplementation guidance (fever, anemia)
- Low effects (3-8%): Recognition/adherence only, no treatment (pneumonia, TB, pregnancy)
- Zero effects (0%): No informal care resolution possible (CHF)

## Summary of All Disease-Specific AI Effects

### 1. **Congestive Heart Failure**
- **Self-care AI**: 0% resolution (no informal care possible), minimal visit reduction
- **Triage AI**: High effectiveness (90%) - emergency recognition
- **CHW AI**: Low effectiveness (30%) - limited role, increases referrals
- **Diagnostic AI**: Moderate (70%) - helps monitoring but increases referrals
- **Bed Management AI**: High (90%) - critical for managing admissions
- **Hospital Decision AI**: High (90%) - complex clinical decisions

### 2. **Childhood Pneumonia**
- **Self-care AI**: 5% resolution (danger signs only, needs antibiotics)
- **Triage AI**: Good effectiveness - respiratory distress recognition
- **CHW AI**: Good (20%) - respiratory rate counting protocols
- **Diagnostic AI**: High (30%) - X-ray AI interpretation
- **Hospital Decision AI**: High - ventilation protocols

### 3. **Malaria**
- **Self-care AI**: 8% resolution (prevention/recognition, limited OTC treatment)
- **Triage AI**: Good effectiveness - fever pattern recognition
- **CHW AI**: High (25%) - RDT guidance and ACT dosing
- **Diagnostic AI**: High (30%) - AI microscopy
- **Hospital Decision AI**: High - severe malaria protocols

### 4. **Diarrhea**
- **Self-care AI**: 25% resolution (ORS preparation guidance - highest)
- **Triage AI**: Good - dehydration assessment
- **CHW AI**: Good (20%) - dehydration assessment
- **Diagnostic AI**: Good - electrolyte management

### 5. **Tuberculosis**
- **Self-care AI**: 5% resolution (adherence support only)
- **Triage AI**: Good - symptom screening algorithms
- **CHW AI**: Low (8%) but increases referrals (25%) - case finding
- **Diagnostic AI**: Excellent (35%) - CAD4TB X-ray screening
- **Hospital Decision AI**: Good - MDR-TB detection

### 6. **High-Risk Pregnancy**
- **Self-care AI**: 3% resolution (danger signs only)
- **Triage AI**: Good - increases facility delivery
- **CHW AI**: Low (8%) but increases referrals (30%)
- **Diagnostic AI**: Low resolution (5%) but high referral increase (25%)
- **Hospital Decision AI**: Good - obstetric emergency protocols

### 7. **HIV Management (Chronic)**
- **Self-care AI**: 8% resolution (adherence support, not treatment)
- **CHW AI**: Moderate (15%) - adherence counseling
- **Diagnostic AI**: Moderate - viral load prediction

### 8. **HIV Opportunistic Infections**
- **Self-care AI**: 5% resolution (mixed - some treatable, most need care)
- **CHW AI**: Low (8%) but increases referrals (35%)
- **Diagnostic AI**: High (30%) - better OI recognition
- **Hospital Decision AI**: Good - complex OI management

### 9. **URTI**
- **Self-care AI**: 18% resolution (complete symptomatic treatment)
- **CHW AI**: Low (8%) - reduces referrals (30%)
- **Diagnostic AI**: Low (5%) - clinical diagnosis

### 10. **Fever**
- **Self-care AI**: 15% resolution (antipyretic guidance)
- **Triage AI**: Moderate - identify serious causes
- **CHW AI**: Moderate (12%) - symptom evaluation
- **Diagnostic AI**: Moderate (15%) - differential diagnosis

### 11. **Anemia**
- **Self-care AI**: 12% resolution (iron supplementation guidance)
- **CHW AI**: Moderate (15%) - supplementation protocols
- **Diagnostic AI**: Good (20%) - point-of-care hemoglobin

## Key Insights

1. **Self-care AI is most effective** for conditions with OTC treatments (diarrhea 25%, URTI 18%, fever 15%)
2. **Diagnostic AI excels** at image/test interpretation (TB 35%, malaria 30%, pneumonia 30%)
3. **CHW AI works best** with clear protocols (malaria RDTs 25%, pneumonia respiratory rate 20%)
4. **Complex conditions** appropriately increase referrals rather than resolution
5. **CHF correctly has 0%** informal care resolution - medical management required
