Congestive Heart Failure,0.09,0.08,0.04,0.025,0.015,0.01,"Untreated CHF has high mortality. Informal care provides minimal benefit (only symptomatic relief). CHW can provide basic diuretics. Primary care adds ACE inhibitors/beta-blockers. Hospital care adds advanced monitoring and interventions."
Tuberculosis,0.003,0.0028,0.0025,0.002,0.0015,0.001,"TB requires 6+ months of antibiotics. Informal care offers negligible benefit. CHW programs with DOTS show modest improvement. Higher levels ensure treatment completion and manage complications."
Pneumonia,0.05,0.045,0.02,0.015,0.01,0.008,"Pneumonia mortality drops significantly with antibiotics. Informal care provides minimal benefit. CHW can provide basic antibiotics. Hospitals add oxygen therapy and IV antibiotics for severe cases."
Malaria,0.03,0.025,0.005,0.003,0.002,0.0015,"Malaria responds well to artemisinin-based therapy. Informal care has limited effect. CHW programs with rapid tests and ACTs are highly effective. Hospitals manage severe malaria with IV artesunate."
Fever of Unknown Origin,0.015,0.012,0.008,0.005,0.003,0.002,"Fever mortality depends on underlying cause. Informal care provides symptomatic relief. Higher levels offer better diagnostics to identify and treat root causes."
Diarrheal Disease,0.025,0.02,0.003,0.002,0.0015,0.001,"Diarrhea responds well to ORS/zinc. Informal care provides some benefit through oral fluids. CHW programs with ORS are highly effective. Hospitals add IV fluids for severe dehydration."
Infant Pneumonia,0.06,0.055,0.025,0.015,0.01,0.007,"Infant pneumonia has higher baseline mortality. Minimal benefit from informal care. Requires prompt antibiotics and often oxygen support. Tertiary care adds mechanical ventilation if needed."
HIV Management (Chronic),0.007,0.0065,0.004,0.002,0.0015,0.001,"HIV requires lifelong ART. Informal care provides no treatment benefit. CHW can support adherence. Higher levels manage complications and treatment failures."
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,0.00002,0.00001,0.00001,0.00001,0.00001,0.00001,"URTI has extremely low mortality. Self-limiting condition. Medical intervention provides minimal mortality benefit at any level."
