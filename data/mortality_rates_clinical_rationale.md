# Clinical Rationale for Revised Mortality Rates

## Overview
This document provides clinical justification for mortality rate revisions across different levels of care for each disease. All rates are weekly probabilities.

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Monotonic Decrease**: Mortality must decrease or remain stable with higher levels of care
2. **Prescription Drug Access**: Informal care cannot provide prescription medications
3. **Level-Appropriate Interventions**: Each level adds specific capabilities
4. **Evidence-Based Rates**: Aligned with WHO and published literature

## Disease-Specific Mortality Rates and Rationale

### 1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.09 | 0.09 | 9% | Severe CHF has ~50% 1-year mortality untreated (Cowie et al., 1997) |
| Informal | 0.06 | 0.08 | 8% | Minimal benefit - no access to ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or diuretics |
| CHW | - | 0.04 | 4% | Basic diuretics significantly reduce mortality |
| Primary | - | 0.025 | 2.5% | Adds ACE inhibitors/ARBs - proven 20-30% mortality reduction |
| District | - | 0.015 | 1.5% | Adds specialist care, echo, advanced diuretics |
| Tertiary | - | 0.01 | 1% | ICU care, mechanical support, transplant evaluation |

**Evidence**: SOLVD trial showed 16% mortality reduction with enalapril. MERIT-HF showed 34% reduction with metoprolol.

### 2. Tuberculosis

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.003 | 0.003 | 0.3% | ~70% 10-year mortality = ~0.3% weekly (Tiemersma et al., 2011) |
| Informal | 0.0025 | 0.0028 | 0.28% | Minimal impact - no antibiotics available |
| CHW | - | 0.0025 | 0.25% | DOTS programs show modest improvement |
| Primary | - | 0.002 | 0.2% | Standard 6-month regimen with monitoring |
| District | - | 0.0015 | 0.15% | MDR-TB management, better adherence |
| Tertiary | - | 0.001 | 0.1% | XDR-TB care, surgical options |

**Evidence**: WHO reports 85% cure rate with DOTS. Untreated TB has 70% 10-year mortality.

### 3. Childhood Pneumonia

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.05 | 0.05 | 5% | Severe pneumonia ~15-20% mortality without antibiotics |
| Informal | 0.035 | 0.045 | 4.5% | Symptomatic care only - minimal mortality benefit |
| CHW | 0.02 | 0.02 | 2% | Oral amoxicillin reduces mortality by 60% |
| Primary | 0.015 | 0.015 | 1.5% | IV antibiotics, basic oxygen |
| District | 0.02 | 0.01 | 1% | Pediatric unit, continuous oxygen, chest X-ray |
| Tertiary | 0.01 | 0.008 | 0.8% | PICU, mechanical ventilation |

**Evidence**: Sazawal & Black (2003) meta-analysis showed 57% mortality reduction with antibiotics.

### 4. Malaria

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.03 | 0.03 | 3% | Severe malaria has 15-20% mortality untreated |
| Informal | 0.02 | 0.025 | 2.5% | Traditional remedies provide minimal benefit |
| CHW | 0.0003 | 0.005 | 0.5% | RDTs + ACTs highly effective (90% reduction) |
| Primary | 0.0002 | 0.003 | 0.3% | Parenteral artesunate for severe cases |
| District | 0.001 | 0.002 | 0.2% | ICU support, transfusion capability |
| Tertiary | 0.0006 | 0.0015 | 0.15% | Dialysis for blackwater fever, advanced ICU |

**Evidence**: AQUAMAT trial showed 22.5% mortality reduction with artesunate vs quinine.

### 5. Fever of Unknown Origin

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.015 | 0.015 | 1.5% | Mixed etiology - varies by cause |
| Informal | 0.008 | 0.012 | 1.2% | Antipyretics provide symptomatic relief only |
| CHW | - | 0.008 | 0.8% | Basic antibiotics cover common bacterial causes |
| Primary | - | 0.005 | 0.5% | Better diagnostics identify treatable causes |
| District | - | 0.003 | 0.3% | Imaging, broader antibiotics |
| Tertiary | - | 0.002 | 0.2% | Specialized diagnostics for rare causes |

### 6. Diarrheal Disease

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.025 | 0.025 | 2.5% | Severe dehydration mortality |
| Informal | 0.015 | 0.02 | 2% | Home fluids provide some benefit |
| CHW | 0.003 | 0.003 | 0.3% | ORS reduces mortality by 93% (Munos et al., 2010) |
| Primary | 0.002 | 0.002 | 0.2% | IV fluids for severe dehydration |
| District | 0.003 | 0.0015 | 0.15% | Pediatric ward, continuous monitoring |
| Tertiary | 0.0015 | 0.001 | 0.1% | ICU for complications |

**Evidence**: Lancet review showed ORS reduces diarrhea mortality by 93%.

### 7. Infant Pneumonia

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.06 | 0.06 | 6% | Very high mortality in <1 year olds |
| Informal | 0.04 | 0.055 | 5.5% | Minimal benefit without antibiotics |
| CHW | - | 0.025 | 2.5% | Oral antibiotics still effective |
| Primary | - | 0.015 | 1.5% | IV antibiotics, oxygen |
| District | - | 0.01 | 1% | Pediatric ICU, CPAP |
| Tertiary | - | 0.007 | 0.7% | NICU, mechanical ventilation |

### 8. HIV Management (Chronic)

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Untreated | 0.007 | 0.007 | 0.7% | ~35% 5-year mortality = ~0.7% weekly |
| Informal | 0.005 | 0.0065 | 0.65% | No ART access - minimal benefit |
| CHW | 0.004 | 0.004 | 0.4% | Adherence support, basic OI prophylaxis |
| Primary | 0.002 | 0.002 | 0.2% | First-line ART reduces mortality by 80% |
| District | 0.015 | 0.0015 | 0.15% | Second-line ART, OI management |
| Tertiary | 2.0 | 0.001 | 0.1% | Third-line ART, advanced OI care |

**Evidence**: ART reduces mortality by 80-90% (Palella et al., 1998).

### 9. Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

| Level | Original | Revised | Weekly Rate | Rationale |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| All levels | 0.00002-0.00001 | 0.00001 | 0.001% | Self-limiting viral infection |

**Evidence**: Essentially zero mortality in immunocompetent hosts.

## Key Clinical Insights

1. **Prescription medications are critical**: Diseases requiring specific drugs (CHF, TB, HIV) show minimal benefit from informal care
2. **CHW programs are highly effective**: When equipped with diagnostics and medications (malaria RDTs, ORS, antibiotics)
3. **Hospital care adds incremental benefit**: Most dramatic improvements occur at primary/CHW level
4. **Infant conditions require aggressive care**: Higher baseline mortality necessitates prompt escalation
